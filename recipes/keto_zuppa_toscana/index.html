    <p>Zuppa toscana is a broad based term, literally meaning "Tuscan soup" but in Italy it is called "Minestra di Pane" meaning "Bread Soup". Classic zuppa toscana normally is a soup made from kale, zucchini, cannellini beans, potatoes, celery, carrots, onion, tomato pulp, extra virgin olive oil, salt, powdered chili, toasted Tuscan bread, and rigatino (an Italian bacon).</p>
